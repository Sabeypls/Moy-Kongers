# Moy-Kongers

A way to order food for the restaurant Moy Kong in Fenton, MI.

Just something to program.

# TODO

Formatting, I think I'm at a good point to flesh out the rest of the menu (aka c/p and change a few text).

Removal of items, the function is there but not implemented.

Stacking of items, 2 different orders of the same items into just 1 order just added on.

Separating cup of soup, 2 combination order but only 1 cup of soup please.

# Future

GUI?

A database would be nice.

# Shout out

Shout out to Ixion#4107 for the assist again!
