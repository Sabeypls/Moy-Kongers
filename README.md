# Moy-Kongers

A way to order food for the restaurant Moy Kong in Fenton, MI.

Just something to program

# TODO

Formatting, so I can c/p the rest of the menu. I've gone through a bit of changes with how I want it to look.

Removal of items (The function is there) but not implemented.

# Future

GUI?

A database would be nice.
